# Michelangelo AI

Michelangelo AI is an open-source platform designed to streamline the development, deployment, and monitoring of machine learning models at scale. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools and services that facilitate the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data management to model serving.

:warning: **Beta Notice**
 This project is currently in beta. APIs and features may evolve, and breaking changes may occur as we continue to improve and stabilize the platform.

**Open Source Initiative**

As part of our commitment to the ML community, we are open-sourcing an **end-to-end lifecycle management system** grounded in extensive operational expertise. Our goals are to:

-   **Drive standardization** and interoperability across the ML ecosystem,
-   **Enable easy adoption** of scalable ML solutions in new production use cases,
-   **Foster innovation and trust** through collaboration with partner teams, and
-   **Cultivate a vibrant and responsible ML culture** that empowers the community to build with confidence and speed.

We are **incrementally open-sourcing Michelangelo AI's core capabilities**, ensuring each release is production-proven and developer-ready. The documentation on this site reflects the current set of available features and will be continuously updated as new components are added to the open-source repository.

## Features

- **Feature Management**: Efficiently handle large datasets with built-in support for data ingestion, transformation, and storage.
- **Model Training**: Train models using various algorithms, including support for distributed training across multiple nodes. The [`michelangelo.lib.trainer.torch.pytorch_lightning`](python/michelangelo/lib/trainer/torch/pytorch_lightning/) package provides a Ray Train wrapper around PyTorch Lightning, with pluggable experiment tracking (Comet, MLflow). See the [MovieLens NCF example](python/examples/movielens/) for an end-to-end walkthrough.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance with a range of metrics and visualization tools.
- **Model Deployment**: Seamlessly deploy models to production environments with support for both batch and real-time inference.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Continuously monitor model performance and log predictions to ensure reliability and accuracy.


## Installation

Follow the [Sandbox Setup](https://michelangelo-ai.org/docs/getting-started/sandbox-setup/) guide to get a fully functional local environment running.

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to define and run an ML pipeline:

```bash
# Clone the repo and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/michelangelo-ai/michelangelo.git
cd michelangelo/python
poetry install
source .venv/bin/activate

# Spin up a local sandbox cluster
ma sandbox create

# Run the demo pipeline to verify everything works
ma sandbox demo pipeline
```

To define your own pipeline, use the `@task` and `@workflow` decorators:

```python
import michelangelo.uniflow.core as uniflow

@uniflow.task()
def train(learning_rate: float = 0.01) -> str:
    # your training logic here
    return "model_path"

@uniflow.workflow()
def my_pipeline(learning_rate: float = 0.01):
    model = train(learning_rate=learning_rate)
```

For a full walkthrough, see the [Getting Started with ML Pipelines](https://michelangelo-ai.org/docs/user-guides/getting-started/getting-started) guide.

## Build and Test

See the [User Guides](https://michelangelo-ai.org/docs/user-guides/) in the documentation for instructions on running tests and working with the development environment.

## Consuming and Using the Containers

See the [Sandbox Setup](https://michelangelo-ai.org/docs/getting-started/sandbox-setup/) guide for instructions on running and importing container images into your local cluster.
