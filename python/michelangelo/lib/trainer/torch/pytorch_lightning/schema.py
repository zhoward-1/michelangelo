class TrainingObserver(Protocol):
    """Protocol for observing training events.

    Implement this protocol to receive notifications when training completes
    or checkpoints are saved.

    **Picklability:** Implementations must be picklable when using per-epoch
    observation (``on_checkpoint_saved``), because Ray serializes the training
    config — including the observer — to worker processes. Avoid storing
    non-picklable objects (open file handles, DB connections, lambdas) as
    instance attributes.

    **Worker-side behavior:** ``on_checkpoint_saved`` is called on **every**
    Ray worker (all ranks), not just rank 0. Implementations should be
    idempotent or guard on rank internally if side effects (DB writes,
    HTTP calls) should only happen once.

    Example::

        from michelangelo.lib.trainer.torch.pytorch_lightning import (
            LightningTrainer,
            LightningTrainerParam,
            TrainingObserver,

                print(f"Checkpoint at epoch {epoch}")
